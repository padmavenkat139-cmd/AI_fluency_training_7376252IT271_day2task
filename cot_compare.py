A farmer has:
- 2 acres of tomato, requiring 1200 litres of water per acre
- 3 acres of rice, requiring 2000 litres of water per acre
- 1 acre of cotton, requiring 1500 litres of water per acre

Calculate:
1. The total water requirement.
2. The amount of water saved with a 15% water-saving method.
3. The final water requirement after the saving.
